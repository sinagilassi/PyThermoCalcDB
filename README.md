**PyThermoCalcDB** — Python Thermodynamic Calculation Engine powered by PyThermoDB

PyThermoCalcDB is a companion package to PyThermoDB, designed to provide a robust set of thermodynamic calculations, utilities, and workflows — using thermodynamic properties, constants, and equations built with PyThermoDB.

## 🚀 Why PyThermoCalcDB?

- **Seamless integration** with PyThermoDB: use the database of thermodynamic data (pure component properties, correlations, etc.) as the foundation.
- **Reusable calculation tools**: functions for various calculations.
- **Consistent with your thermodynamic ecosystem**: fits with existing packages like PyThermoModels, PyPhaseEQ, PyThermoFlash — offering a central “calculation engine” layer.
- **Minimal dependencies**: lean design, using PyThermoDB as core data source; optionally depend on well-known numerical libraries (e.g. NumPy, SciPy) if needed for complex calculations.
- **Flexible use-cases**: from quick property lookups to advanced process calculations, or integration in larger workflows or multi-agent systems.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install pyThermoCalcDB
```
