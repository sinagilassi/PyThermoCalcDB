# PyThermoCalcDB v0.7.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 8, 2026

## Highlights

- New MkDocs documentation set with overview, method reference, and examples pages.
- README usage section rewritten with clearer ModelSource setup and helper module guidance.
- Example snippets aligned with the documented thermo, saturation, and reaction helper APIs.

## What changed

### Documentation and DX
- Added `docs/index.md`, `docs/docs.md`, and `docs/examples.md` with structured tables for thermo (`calc_En`, `calc_GiFrEn`, `calc_dEn`, `calc_dEnt`, `calc_En_mix`), saturation (`calc_VaPr`, `calc_EnVap`, `calc_T_sat`, sensitivities), and reaction (`dEn_rxn_STD`, `dGiFrEn_rxn_STD`) helpers.
- Configured `mkdocs.yml` navigation (Overview, Methods & API, Examples) using Material theme features and code-copy support.
- Updated README “🚀 Usage” to show ModelSource construction, helper calls, and notes on `mode` logging options.

### Examples
- Examples now reference the documented helpers and demonstrate end-to-end flows for property lookups, phase-change calculations, and reaction energetics.
- Notes call out typed inputs (`Component`, `Temperature`, `Pressure`) and expected units.

## Known issues

- Some legacy glyphs in older release notes and sections remain; these will be cleaned up in a future release.

## Contributors

Thanks to everyone who helped refine the docs and examples for this release.
